# 3rd ML 100 Days - Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning progress in the **3rd ML 100 Days** program.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation in machine learning by following a structured curriculum.

## Learning Approach
- Follow the **100 Days of ML** challenge.
- Complete hands-on exercises and projects.
- Summarize key takeaways from each lesson.

## Content Overview
- **Basic Python & Data Handling**: Numpy, Pandas, Data Visualization.
- **Supervised Learning**: Regression, Classification, Model Evaluation.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.
- **Deep Learning Basics**: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs.
- **Real-world Applications**: Kaggle competitions, practical case studies.
